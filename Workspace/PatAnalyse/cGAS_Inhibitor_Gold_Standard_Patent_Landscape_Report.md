## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 The cGAS-STING Pathway: Biological Foundation

The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) - stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway represents one of the most significant discoveries in innate immunity of the past decade. First characterized by Dr. Zhijian "James" Chen at the University of Texas Southwestern in 2013, this pathway serves as a critical cytosolic DNA sensor that triggers type I interferon responses and inflammatory signaling.

**Pathway Mechanism:**
1. **DNA Recognition:** cGAS detects cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from various sources including damaged mitochondria, nuclear DNA leakage, or pathogenic organisms
2. **Second Messenger Production:** Upon DNA binding, cGAS synthesizes the cyclic dinucleotide 2'3'-cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP)
3. **STING Activation:** cGAMP binds to and activates STING, leading to IRF3 and NF-κB activation
4. **Inflammatory Response:** Downstream signaling results in type I interferon production and inflammatory cytokine release

**Therapeutic Rationale:**
While this pathway is essential for antimicrobial defense, aberrant activation contributes to numerous autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Excessive cGAS-STING signaling has been implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), rheumatoid arthritis, and various interferonopathies, making cGAS an attractive therapeutic target for selective pathway inhibition.

### 2.2 Disease Relevance and Market Opportunity
